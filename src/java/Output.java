/**
  * A Tsugi application makes use of this class as follows:
  *
  * <pre><code>
  *     PrintWriter out = res.getWriter();
  *
  *     Launch launch = tsugi.getLaunch(req, res);
  *     if ( launch.isComplete() ) return;
  *
  *     Output o = launch.getOutput();
  *
  *     Properties p = o.header(out);
  *     out.println("&lt;title&gt;Sample&lt;/title&gt;");
  *     o.bodyStart(out);
  *     o.navStart(out); // If you want it..
  *     o.flashMessages(out);
  *
  *     out.println("&lt;pre&gt;");
  *     out.println("Welcome to hello world!");
  *     out.println("&lt;/pre&gt;");
  *
  *     o.navEnd(out); // If you started it
  *     o.footerStart(out);
  *     // Some of my own JavaScript goodness
  *     $(document).ready( ... );
  *     o.footerEnd(out);
  * </code></pre>
  *
  * The header() only includes the CSS for the libraries.  The 
  * the JavaScript librarys are included by footerStart().  This
  * is where the tool can add JQuery plugins or include JavaScript of its
  * own.
  *
  * The implementation of this class is likely to evolve quite a bit
  * as we someday add features to LMS systems like Sakai and OAE to share 
  * their navigation bits with Tsugi tools.  So don't dig too deep into
  * the implementations or hack the static files too much.
