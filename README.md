Tsugi Node Library
==================

This is a Tsugi Node library Hack space.  We are using ES6 and NodeJS 6.0.

At this point it is mostly just exploring the OO model where we need to work
with all of these simultaneously:

* ES6
* NodeJS require pattern 
* esdoc

Of course do this after downloading:

    npm install

To run test code:

    node test.js

It is not a server - more of a simple straight line test.   You can
also run [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) if you want it 
to watch the folder and restart on any file change.

To make the documentation install [ESDOC](http://esdoc.org) and run:

    esdoc -c esdoc.json

And open `esdoc/index.html`
